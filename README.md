# Identification-of-phytophagous-pests-through-machine-learning
Techable Machine is a project developed by Google that allows users to train machine learning models in an interactive and accessible way, including using Tensorflow models to use images as training. This specific project aims to help identify pests of domestic plants and facilitate the diagnosis of treatments for such pests.

This software is the result of a small university project, so, using a larger image base and over time creating a better interface, it can be implemented in real situations.

Python libraries used: "cv2", "Tensorflow", "Pillow", "numpy", "os".
